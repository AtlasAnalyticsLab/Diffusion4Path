# Comparative analysis of Diffusion Generative Models

## Overview
This repository presents a modified and extended version of the original [diffusion-ddpm](https://github.com/mattroz/diffusion-ddpm/) and [CompVis/latent-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) implementation. The initial codebase has been borrowed from the original project, and additional methods have been implemented 


## Repository Structure

- **ddpm/**: Contains the implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), with added sampling methods and improvements for better performance.
  
- **ldm/**: Focuses on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), which operate in a compressed latent space for faster and more efficient model training and inference.
