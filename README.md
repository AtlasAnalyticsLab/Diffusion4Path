## Overview
This repository presents a modified and extended version of the original [diffusion-ddpm](https://github.com/mattroz/diffusion-ddpm/) and [CompVis/latent-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) implementation. The initial codebase has been borrowed from the original project, and additional methods and features have been implemented to enhance functionality.
